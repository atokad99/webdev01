Hi there! I work at a small computer store and have created / worked on several websites for customers. Usually through wordpress or Wix, so I don't have much experience with coding. I did work on one website using React and NodeJS, so I know a little about them. I'm really looking forward to learning different frameworks to expand my knowledge. 

I have always wanted to be better at javascript and web developement in general, so I am hoping that I will be a much better web programmer after taking this course.
